# median_house_value_predictor

I created a data pipeline to prepare the data in the csv file to be used by the machine learning algorithms. Then I have developed several regression models to predict the median house value from a dataset based on california homes. Finally, utilizing both grid search and random grid search I tune hyperparameters of the models. Open the [notebook](https://github.com/AbdulRahmanSilmy/median_house_value_predictor/blob/main/housing_project.ipynb) to see more details on the development of the regression models.
